/// Notes:
//   I've been experiencing some instablity that randomly crashes the game when opening/changing maps
//   The cause has not yet been determined, and the process of narrowing it down has proven challenging, as it exits immediately with limited feedback
//   Current hypothesis is that it is related to io failure or delay, possibly caused by trying to read too much data from disk too quickly
//   Unfortunately there does not seem to be a convenient solution:
//     Flash requires that the icons be reloaded every time they are used unless they are defined as part of a library type
//       Defining them as part of a library type means that they will no longer be available to the user for customization/extension
//       Movie clips, once created, are locked to their parent, and without the library type can only be duplicated as children of their own
//       Duplicated movie clips do not contain dynamically loaded content from their parent, it must be re-loaded
//       The window system expects that the window content be a child element of it, and that it be destroyed and re-created each time the window is closed
//     A similar set of arguments is present for the map files, though the motivation there is more an ease of extension than actual customization
//   The current strategy for dealing with this is attempted mitigation, with stability to be assessed as development approaches a more complete product:
//     Attemptng to be clean with the code, explicitly tidy up memory leaks and close things off when they are no longer in use
//     Avoid loading more than required, notation layers can defer loading of markers if they are hidden and can reuse existing markers when changing maps
//     Stage the loading, ensure that the map and layers load sequentially rather than asynchronously, possibly with delays so that large data sets don't devour entire time blocks
//     Extensive use of Mod.LogMsg() in an effort to trace/locate any replicatable crash locations
